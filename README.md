# Achievement

### 1. This project has brought over 10 additional contracts.

Some of the biggest projects I've worked on are listed below.



- [Unesco International 3D Online Conference](https://iclc2021.govent.io/)
- [UIA & STO International 3D Online Conference](https://wclf2021.miceworld.or.kr/) 
- [IOHA2021 International Scientific Conference](https://ioha2021conference.org/) 
- [KHA Online Conference & Exhibition](https://khc2020.salin.co.kr) ( Korean Hospital Association )
- Asia TEFL International 3D Online Conference

### 2. This project motivated me to build a reactjs open-source library


[![demo photo](assets/crontab.png)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reactjs-crontab)
[Link To The Library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reactjs-crontab)

I realised having a crontab (scheduling jobs) function in front-end is quite useful in many cases but very tedious to implement and test. I knew such a function will be used many times in our projects. I wouldn't want to repeat the same implementation. This motivated me to build a React library called reactjs-crontab to help myself and other devs who are having a similar problem. This pacakge allows you to easily schedule a job. There is an average of approximately 300 weekly downloads.


### 3. Created reusable components and APIs.

I created several reusable components and APIs out of this project which saved my team 10 person-hours each month and significantly reduced errors in development.

### 4. Learned how to optimize React app performance.

As the application grew, it started getting too much re-render and slowed the app down. Particularly, I was surprised when HTML auto-canvasing functionality no longer worked after adding several logics to it. In the debugging and optimizing process, I learned about several methods such as React.memo, HOC, React.useCallback, lazyload, algorithms and so on.    

# Note 

Due to the company policy, I can only open the client-side source code.
